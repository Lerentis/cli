# Overmind CLI

CLI to interact with the overmind API

```
Usage:
  ovm-cli [command]

Available Commands:
  completion             Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell

  get-change             Displays the contents of a change.
  get-snapshot           Displays the contents of a snapshot.
  help                   Help about any command
  list-changes           Displays the contents of a change.
  list-invites           List all invites
  manual-change          Creates a new Change from a given query
  request                Runs a request against the overmind API
  revoke-invites         Revoke an existing invite
  start-change           Starts the specified change. Call this just before you're about to start the change. This will store a snapshot of the current system state for later reference.
  submit-plan            Creates a new Change from a given terraform plan file

Flags:
      --api-key string             The API key to use for authentication, also read from OVM_API_KEY environment variable
      --api-key-url string         The overmind API Keys endpoint (defaults to --url)
      --auth0-client-id string     OAuth Client ID to use when connecting with auth (default "j3LylZtIosVPZtouKI8WuVHmE6Lluva1")

  -h, --help                       help for ovm-cli
      --honeycomb-api-key string   If specified, configures opentelemetry libraries to submit traces to honeycomb. This requires --otel to be set.
      --json-log                   Set to true to emit logs as json for easier parsing.
      --log string                 Set the log level. Valid values: panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace (default "info")
      --otel                       If specified, configures opentelemetry and - optionally, see --sentry-dsn - sentry using their default environment configs.
      --run-mode string            Set the run mode for this service, 'release', 'debug' or 'test'. Defaults to 'release'. (default "release")
      --sentry-dsn string          If specified, configures sentry libraries to capture errors. This requires --otel to be set.
      --stdout-trace-dump          Dump all otel traces to stdout for debugging. This requires --otel to be set.
      --url string                 The overmind API endpoint (default "https://api.prod.overmind.tech")
  -v, --version                    version for ovm-cli

Use "ovm-cli [command] --help" for more information about a command.

## Examples

Upload a terraform plan to overmind for Blast Radius Analysis:

```
terraform show -json ./tfplan > ./tfplan.json
ovm-cli submit-plan --title "example change" ./tfplan1.json ./tfplan2.json ./tfplan3.json
```

## Terraform âž¡ Overmind Mapping

In order to calculate the blast radius from a Terraform plan, we use mappings provided by the sources to map a Terraform resource change to an Overmind item. In many cases this is simple, however in some instances, the plan doesn't have enough information for us to determine which resource the change is referring to. A good example is a Terraform environment that manages 2x Kubernetes deployments in 2x clusters which both have the same name.

By default we'll add both deployments to the blast radius since we can't tell them apart. However to improve the results, you can add the `overmind_mappings` output to your plan:

```hcl
output "overmind_mappings" {
  value = {
    # The key here should be the name of the provider. Resources that use this
    # provider will be mapped to a cluster with the below name. If you had
    # another provider with an alias such as "prod" the name would be
    # "kubernetes.prod"
    kubernetes = {
      cluster_name = var.terraform_env_name
    }
  }
}
```

Valid mapping values are:

* `cluster_name`: The name of the cluster that was provided to the kubernetes source using the `source.clusterName` option
